  <h2 class="heading--main text-center">About me</h2>
  <p>My name is <b>Bruno</b>, and I am a self-taught <b>game developer</b>, most interested in the vast topic of game design. 
    I'm ambitious and hungry for knowledge, looking for opportunities to learn and evolve in all things related to game dev. 
    I like working on unique, boundary pushing projects that aren't afraid to try new things, and crafting unforgettable experiences for the players.</p>
  <p>I've been interested in game-making since I was very young, when my friends and I would make "games" in <b>Microsoft PowerPoint</b> which were just interactive presentations, that allowed the user to choose various options. 
    After that, we moved on to tools like <b>YoYo Games' GameMaker</b>, and most importantly <b>Clickteam Fusion 2.5</b>. It was in that program where I started making things that could be considered real games.</p>
  <p>The first game I actually released on the Internet, was <i><b>Survive The Zombies: Arena</b></i> in 2016. 
    I made it available on Game Jolt where it became a moderate success, gaining a couple hundred views. 
    After that, I continued on making games in <b>Clickteam Fusion 2.5</b> for a few years, eventually releasing my final game in that engine, <i><b>VOID_r</b></i> in early 2018.
    This project was vital in my evolution as a game developer, as I gained a lot of valuable feedback from it, and it shaped my approach to making games in the years to come.</p>
  <p>Following the release of <i><b>VOID_r</b></i>, I started experimenting with <b>Unity</b>, during which I helped my friends with some projects. 
    It finally ended with us deciding to take part in the <b>2019 Dallas Dreamhack Game Jam</b>, where for the first time I was credited on a released project as a <b>Unity developer</b>. 
    That project was <i><b>5 Minutes to Survive The Zombies</b></i>, which was an important learning experience.</p>
  <p>Since then, I kept working on games in <b>Unity</b>, though with time my role moved more towards game design and QA. 
    That doesn't mean I don't write code though, as I'm still learning and working on solo projects as a hobby. 
    I'm currently working in IT Support and studying Computer Science at WSEI Krak√≥w.
    The newest public project I worked on is <i><b>Telegraphist 1920: Beats of War</b></i> as a <b>game designer</b>, <b>QA tester</b> and <b>proofreader/translator</b>.
